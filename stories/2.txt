As a user submitting prayer requests, I want to a choice to anonymously or non anonymously submit them in terms of my username. For sensitive topics like ex. lust or porn addiction recovery, I might want to share it without others knowing my username. However, when I am submitting prayers that are linked over time, I want my username to be public. For example, I am praying for conversion of specific person named John Doe. 2 months later, suppose that John doe starts going to church. I might share a prayer request that he continues going to church and feels the presence of the holy spirit more. If they know my username and know that I am the same person who submitted both of those prayer requests, they have more context and also get feedback that God is working through these prayers.
