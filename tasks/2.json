                "I am struggling to read the book by itself because the topics aren't registering to me very easily. The book feels insightful and reflective, although somewhat dry for my taste. I am going to find it easier to read once I start having discussions about the topics presented in the book. Then, I can go back and pay attention to specific topics in the book."
